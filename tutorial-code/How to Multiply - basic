@ Program to multiply two numbers
@ important point to remember with multiply:
@ you cannot multiply constants, you need to multiply registers
@ meaning numbers should be stored in registers first.

	.global main
	main:

	MOV R1, #0x14 @ Put 20 in R1
	MOV R2, #0xA @ Put 10 in R2
	MUL R0, R1, R2 @ Multiply 20 * 10, store in R0
	MOV R7, #1 @ Exit with a system call
	SWI 0 @ End program and return to terminal
