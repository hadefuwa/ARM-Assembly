@ Program to multiply two numbers 
@ & then accumulate the result onto another register
@ (R1 * R2) + R3, store in R0
@ computes the product of two numbers and adds that product to an accumulator.

	.global main
	main:

	MOV R1, #0x14 @ Put 20 in R1
	MOV R2, #0xA @ Put 10 in R2
	MOV R3, #0x5 @ Put 5 in R3
	MLA R0, R1, R2, R3 @ (R1 * R2) + R3, store in R0
	MOV R7, #1 @ Exit with a system call
	SWI 0 @ End program and return to terminal
